Hey there, I'm a PhD Student at [STU FEI](https://www.fei.stuba.sk/) and Software Developer at [Omicron Lab](https://www.omicron-lab.com/).

I obtained my Master degree in computer science at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/) and wrote my thesis at the [Theory and Application of Algorithms Research Group](https://taa.cs.univie.ac.at/) about the Optimization of Graph Neural Networks. For my Bachelor thesis I had the opportunity to work on the Inverse Laplace Transform using Vector Fitting at Omicron Lab. Before I studied Mathematics and Physics for Teaching at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/de/).

My main fields of interest are:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning
- Numerical Algorithms (in particular Eigenvalue problems and convex optimization)

## Research
For my PhD I am working on Robot Imitation Learning from 2D videos under the supervision of Prof. Frantisek Duchon. I focus on dexterous tasks which are done with hands. I am particularly interested in
- Robot Pose Estimation (including Robotic hands) to connect Video generation models with Robot Actions
- Imitation Learning using (2d) videos (Learning from Observations)
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Please see my profile at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Fetzel) for a list of publications I contributed to.
